# Native post attachments and visibility — 2026-09-30

Task: `GA-20260930-post-attachments`.

Scope/order: implement the product-owned artifact journey in each separate
assigned worktree, stack after Yurucommu #43 / Yurumeet #16, independently review,
then run complete owner gates serially and return exact heads/CI/dependencies.
Parent owns scripts/release-post-journey.mjs, the product journey and its smoke
tests. Original install and Unicode-search work remains outside this unit.

Acceptance candidates: the actual password-issued owner session uploads distinct
PNG images for public and followers posts. Use the UI attachment payload and
public default; require Note/owner/visibility/attachment agreement across POST,
SQL and GET, correlated outbound Create and durable followers fanout intent,
ActivityPub Document/absolute URL/alt text without internal storage keys, exact
public image bytes/cache policy, unsigned followers ActivityPub refusal and
followers image refusal to anonymous and unrelated actors. Preserve existing unattached/private and revoked-cookie
checks and refuse anonymous/revoked post writes without durable effects.

Fixtures have no followers or mentions; no actual external delivery is performed.
Only native disposable stores and internal queue wakeups are exercised. The two
locked Core create/read paths agree; deletion differs between versions and is
outside this unit. No Core/API/provider pin, schema, authorization, installation,
deployment, production resource or real-data change is introduced. Shared defects
are proposals to the principal, never edits to common owner repositories.

Source/native artifact and CI evidence remain separate from package publication,
managed install, real cross-server federation, live browser/native journeys,
lifecycle, recovery and monitoring. Those remain necessary evidence for the full
family GA goal. No new billing, rights, deploy or destructive real-data operation.

Local complete gate: Bun 1.3.14 / OpenTofu 1.12.3, 209 passed / 0 failed
and 6 mock-provider plan tests passed. Full gates ran serially after an empty
global full-check slot; all tracked/new source checksums matched before/after.
This result paragraph is the only source addition afterward. Independent
read-only review is complete with no remaining finding. Nine targeted artifact
mutants all reproduced false green with the previous committed journey
(0 passed / 9 expected-failure tests failed), then were rejected by the new
journey. Both native password fixture methods passed. Exact-head CI, published
bytes and live qualification remain separate evidence.
